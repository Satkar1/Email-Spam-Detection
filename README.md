## üåü Overview

The **Email Spam Detection** project is a Machine Learning application designed to classify emails as spam or not spam. Users input the content of an email, and the application provides an instant classification based on the trained ML model.  

The goal of this project is to create a real-world, practical demonstration of how Machine Learning models can address spam email filtering‚Äîa common challenge in email communication.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend development and machine learning.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web application.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading pretrained models and vectorizers.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: To classify emails effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.9 or later must be installed.  
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satkar1/Email-Spam-Detection.git
   cd Email-Spam-Detection
   ```

### Install Required Libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìà Project Workflow

1. **Input Data**: Users provide email content via the text box in the Streamlit app.  
2. **Vectorization**: Input email text is vectorized using the preloaded `TfidfVectorizer`.  
3. **Prediction**: The Logistic Regression model classifies the vectorized data.  
4. **Output Display**: Results are shown on the app interface as "Spam" or "Not Spam".

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add a **Dark Mode** to the app for better accessibility.  
- Integrate **email datasets** for live testing directly from the app.  
- Deploy a **REST API** for broader platform integration.  
- Enhance the ML model using advanced algorithms like Random Forest or SVM.
